## Brief Introduction

Swirlyyyy VR is the VR version of Swirlyyy, a music running game on Gear VR. As a musical elf, the player is trying to hit beat rings in a mysterious, infinite tunnel. Players will tilt their head to the left and right to rotate the in-game avatar around the tunnel so that the avatar can hit the rings placed at different spots in the tunnel.

## My Role in the Team

As a game designer, I redesigned the manipulation from keyboards to head tilting.

As a game developer, I developed an endless 3D pipe generator using 3D math, controls with gravity sensor within the Unity platform, and developed controls using the sensor of head tilting within the Unity platform for deployment to Gear VR.

## Background

When I showed the game to my friends and players at the VR Jubilee, I saw them enjoy the game, especially the experience of tilting their head to play it. In my opinion, there remain huge potentials for designing interactive experiences for VR games that wait for designers to explore.

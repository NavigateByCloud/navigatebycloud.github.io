## Brief Introduction

BeRrY is a two-player competitive abstract strategy game. This game is played with smart programmable hexagon pieces called Blinks. With 6 Blinks shapes, 3 colors, and 4 scoring shapes involved, BeRrY brings players a highly intelligent, elegant, and simplified Go-like playing experience.

## My Role in the Team

As a game developer, I implemented the game with Arduino (C++).

As a game designer, I:

- Concepted and iterated a neat gateway game, which earned a licensing contract for us.
- Iterated on clean and concise rule-writing to ensure there is no ambiguous description. You can view the [Rules of BeRrY](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11vRISO0vzHCNTK82baSalQpbK05I1csfQMx6Kd8c1Ko/edit?usp=sharing) and reference sheets.
- Cut a playthrough video.

## Background

BeRrY is designed by Vivi Yu and me in IndieCade 2018 Alt-ware Game Jam, and we got the best game design prize! Then we were awarded a contract for licensing so that it will be released with Blinks.

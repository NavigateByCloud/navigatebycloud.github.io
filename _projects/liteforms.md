Liteforms is an innovative Unity3D project I spearheaded at Looking Glass Factory, empowering users to design and interact with conversational AI characters on both Mac and Windows platforms. This application redefines user engagement by blending creativity with cutting-edge AI technology. Explore the full potential of Liteforms and see it in action at the [Liteforms Website](https://lookingglassfactory.com/liteforms).

I implemented almost all the UI pages. Below are screenshots.

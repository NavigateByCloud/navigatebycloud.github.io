Liteforms is a Unity3D project that I led in Looking Glass Factory for users to create and chat with conversational AI characters on Mac/Windows. Check more details at the [Liteforms Website](https://lookingglassfactory.com/liteforms).

I implemented almost all the UI pages. Below are screenshots.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/liteforms customization.png" title="avatar" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This is a page for users to input the basic information for their custom character
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/liteforms character running.png" title="avatar" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can talk to the character and control your conversation.

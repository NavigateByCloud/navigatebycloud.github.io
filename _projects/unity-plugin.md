The Looking Glass Unity Plugin is a powerful tool I developed and maintained over several years at Looking Glass Factory. This plugin transforms the way developers create holographic experiences, offering a robust set of features through 9 meticulously crafted sample scenes. From hologram rendering to advanced interaction controls, this plugin is designed to elevate Unity projects with cutting-edge 3D display technology.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Scene Execution**: Seamlessly run interactive scenes directly within the Unity editor or in packaged builds.
- **iOS Compatibility**: Develop and deploy apps tailored for iOS devices, expanding your reach.
- **Hologram Recording**: Capture stunning holograms directly from the Unity editor for playback or sharing.
- **Hardware Integration**: Utilize hardware buttons on Looking Glass devices for enhanced control (Windows only).
- **Advanced Visuals**: Leverage a post-processing stack specifically optimized for holographic content.
- **Intuitive Controls**: Implement a 3D cursor and orbit controls for natural, immersive holographic interactions.

### Recent Developments

One of my latest contributions to this plugin is the iOS sample scene, complete with a detailed step-by-step setup guide. Below are screenshots showcasing the iOS integration process. Additionally, I authored the comprehensive [documentation](https://docs.lookingglassfactory.com/software/index/script-reference/ios-sample-scene-scripts) to assist developers in harnessing the full capabilities of this tool.

Unity Plugin is a project that I developed and maintained at Looking Glass Factory for years. It contains 9 sample scenes including features like hologram rendering, video recording, 3D cursor, virtual XR camera, hardware button support, UI support, iOS support, screenshot and video recording.

Features

- Run interactive scenes from within the Unity editor and in packaged builds
- Create apps for iOS devices
- Record holograms from the Unity editor
- Use hardware buttons for Looking Glass devices (Windows only)
- Post-processing stack for holograms
- iOS support
- 3D cursor and orbit controls for holographic interactions

The most recent feature I was working on is the iOS sample scene with a step-by-step setup guide.Also I wrote the [documentation](<https://lookingglassfactory.com/software/looking-glass-unity-plugin](https://docs.lookingglassfactory.com/software/index/script-reference/ios-sample-scene-scripts)>)

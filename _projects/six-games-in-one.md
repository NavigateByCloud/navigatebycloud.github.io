## Brief Introduction

They/it consist(s) of six games which play simultaneously on the same screen. There is no end state so just play until you've had enough.

## My Role in the Team

I implemented the text game within Unity with Twine-to-Unity plugin.

Credits:
- 2D Rolling Game: Corey Bertelsen
- Flying Game: Dennis Carr
- 3D Katamari Game: Jenna Galka
- Sprite Collage: Milan Koerner-Safrata
- Toilet FPS: Longxiao Li
- Twine-style Game: Shiyun "Vanilla" Liu

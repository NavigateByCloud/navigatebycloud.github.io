## Brief Introduction

Swirlyyy is a two-player endless rhythm racer. Each player controls a single rhythm sprite and tries to go towards color-matching rings without hitting others.

## My Role in the Team

The game is made by Vanilla Liu, Vivi Yu, and Zuoyang Liu in two weeks. I was one of the programmers in the team.

As a programmer, I worked collaboratively with Vivi on developing controls, collision, particle effects, data serialization, and an endless 3D pipe generator using 3D math. I also collaborated with the artist, Zuoyang, to efficiently integrate layouts, animations, and art assets into game features.

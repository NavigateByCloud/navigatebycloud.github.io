## Brief Introduction

Card Odyssey is a 54-card based solitaire strategy game. Your goal in this game is to help the hero kill the monster. Unlike traditional RPGs, in Card Odyssey, you need to be patient and wait for the right moment to kill the monster. Carefully manage and distribute all the resources you get, and wait for the exciting moment of victory!

## My Role in the Team

- As a game designer, I contributed to the iterative design.
- As a game programmer, I implemented and iterated on core gameplay and UI interface to ensure the final version is efficient and bug-free within Unity (C#).
- As a graphic designer, I drew all the assets in the game with Adobe Illustrator.

## Background

Card Odyssey was made by Vivi Yu and myself in 2018 Train Jam.

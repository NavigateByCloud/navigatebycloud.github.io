Hi, I'm Shiyun — a software engineer and game developer based in New York City.
I studied game programming during undergrad and earned my master’s in game design. My passion lies in creating casual, simulation, RPG, and strategy games that offer players 100% enjoyment — immersive, engaging, and fun from start to finish.

I also enjoy building tools that help users eliminate repetitive, tedious work — freeing them to focus on what truly matters. Over the past few years, I’ve been working with Unity, and recently started exploring Godot, which I find refreshingly intuitive and fun to develop with.

Feel free to explore the [Projects](/projects/) section to see some of the work I've done!

Outside of tech, I'm a dedicated art lover. I spend time practicing quick sketching, figure drawing, and traditional Chinese painting — creative outlets that fuel my imagination both in code and on canvas.
